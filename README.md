# **SQL-Bixi-Project**

### **Bixi Project - Part 1 & 2 - Data Analysis in SQL**
This project consists of two deliverables. In the first deliverable we will use SQL to dig into the Bixi dataset. While in the second deliverable we will further explore the data using Tableau and consistent with the visualization. Our goal is to gain a high level understanding of how people use Bixi bikes, what factors influence the volume of usage, popular stations and overall business growth.

The data is a cleaned up version of data downloaded from the open data portal at Bixi Montreal: https://www.bixi.com/en/open-data
